# Recursion in Java

Recursion is a programming concept where a method calls itself in order to solve a problem. In Java, recursive methods can be used to break down complex problems into simpler subproblems. Here, we'll cover the basics of recursion and provide examples.

## Basics of Recursion

A recursive method is a method that calls itself during its execution. It typically involves two parts:

1. **Base Case**: A condition that determines when the recursion should stop. It prevents the method from calling itself indefinitely.

2. **Recursive Case**: The part of the method where it calls itself with a modified input, moving closer to the base case.

## Example: Factorial Using Recursion

The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted as n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

```java
public class Factorial {

    // Recursive method to calculate factorial
    public static int calculateFactorial(int n) {
        // Base case
        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        // Recursive case
        return n * calculateFactorial(n - 1);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 5;
        int result = calculateFactorial(number);
        System.out.println("Factorial of " + number + " is: " + result);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `calculateFactorial` method is defined recursively to calculate the factorial of a number.

## Example: Fibonacci Sequence Using Recursion

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

```java
public class Fibonacci {

    // Recursive method to calculate Fibonacci number
    public static int calculateFibonacci(int n) {
        // Base case
        if (n <= 1) {
            return n;
        }
        // Recursive case
        return calculateFibonacci(n - 1) + calculateFibonacci(n - 2);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 6;
        int result = calculateFibonacci(number);
        System.out.println("Fibonacci sequence at position " + number + " is: " + result);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `calculateFibonacci` method is defined recursively to find the Fibonacci number at a given position.

## Advantages and Considerations

### Advantages of Recursion

- **Simplicity**: Recursive solutions often closely mirror the natural structure of a problem.
- **Readability**: Recursion can lead to more readable and concise code for certain problems.

### Considerations for Recursion

- **Memory Usage**: Recursive solutions may consume more memory as each recursive call adds a new layer to the call stack.
- **Performance**: In some cases, iterative solutions may be more efficient than recursive ones.

## Summary

- Recursion is a programming concept where a method calls itself to solve a problem.
- A recursive method typically has a base case and a recursive case.
- Recursive solutions can be advantageous for certain problems but may have considerations such as memory usage and performance.
