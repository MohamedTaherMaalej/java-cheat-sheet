# Garbage Collection in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

Garbage collection is a crucial aspect of memory management in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It is responsible for automatically identifying and reclaiming memory that is no longer in use by objects in a Java program. This document provides an overview of garbage collection in the JVM.

## How Garbage Collection Works

1. **Object Allocation**: When objects are created, memory is allocated for them in the heap.
2. **Reference Tracking**: The JVM keeps track of references to objects to determine their reachability.
3. **Identification of Garbage**: Unreachable objects are considered garbage.
4. **Reclamation**: Garbage collector reclaims the memory occupied by unreachable objects.

## Generational Garbage Collection

The JVM typically divides the heap into two main areas: the Young Generation and the Old Generation.

### Young Generation

- Newly created objects are allocated in the Young Generation.
- Consists of three spaces: Eden, and two survivor spaces (S0 and S1).
- Minor garbage collection (Minor GC) occurs frequently in the Young Generation.

### Old Generation (Tenured)

- Objects that survive multiple rounds of garbage collection in the Young Generation are promoted to the Old Generation.
- Major garbage collection (Major GC) occurs less frequently in the Old Generation.

## Types of Garbage Collectors

### Serial Garbage Collector

- Single-threaded garbage collector.
- Suitable for small applications or applications with a small dataset.

### Parallel Garbage Collector

- Multi-threaded garbage collector that performs minor GC in parallel.
- Suitable for applications with larger datasets.

### CMS Garbage Collector

- Concurrent Mark-Sweep (CMS) collector.
- Performs garbage collection concurrently with the application threads.
- Minimizes pauses but may have higher CPU usage.

### G1 Garbage Collector

- Garbage-First (G1) collector.
- Divides the heap into regions and performs garbage collection based on the regions.
- Designed to meet low-latency requirements.

## JVM Garbage Collection Tuning

1. **Heap Size**: Adjust the overall heap size (`-Xmx`, `-Xms`) based on the application's memory requirements.
2. **GC Algorithm**: Choose the garbage collector algorithm based on the application's characteristics.
3. **GC Logging**: Enable garbage collection logging (`-Xloggc:filename`) for performance analysis.
4. **Tuning Flags**: Use JVM tuning flags to optimize garbage collection behavior.

```bash
java -Xmx512m -Xms256m -XX:+UseG1GC -Xloggc:gc.log -jar YourApplication.jar
```

## Conclusion

Understanding garbage collection in the JVM is essential for writing efficient and scalable Java applications. By selecting the appropriate garbage collector and tuning JVM parameters, developers can optimize memory usage and minimize application pauses.
