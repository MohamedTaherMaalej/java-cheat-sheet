# Try-Catch Blocks in Java Exception Handling

In Java, exceptions are used to handle unexpected events that can occur during the execution of a program. The `try` and `catch` blocks are fundamental constructs used for exception handling. Here, we'll cover the basics of using try-catch blocks in Java.

## Basics of Try-Catch Blocks

The `try` block is used to enclose a section of code where an exception might occur. The `catch` block is used to handle and process the exception if it occurs. The combination of `try` and `catch` provides a mechanism to gracefully handle errors.

### Syntax

```java
try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (ExceptionType e) {
    // Code to handle the exception
}
```

- The `try` block contains the code that may throw an exception.
- The `catch` block specifies the type of exception to catch and contains the code to handle the exception.

## Example

```java
public class TryCatchExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int result = divide(10, 0);
            System.out.println("Result: " + result);
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    public static int divide(int numerator, int denominator) {
        return numerator / denominator;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `divide` method may throw an `ArithmeticException` if the denominator is zero. The `try` block in the `main` method attempts to call the `divide` method, and if an exception occurs, the `catch` block handles it by printing an error message.

## Multiple Catch Blocks

You can have multiple `catch` blocks to handle different types of exceptions.

```java
try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (ExceptionType1 e) {
    // Code to handle ExceptionType1
} catch (ExceptionType2 e) {
    // Code to handle ExceptionType2
}
```

- Each `catch` block can handle a different type of exception.
- The first matching `catch` block is executed based on the type of the thrown exception.

## Finally Block

The `finally` block, if present, is executed regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It is commonly used for cleanup operations.

```java
try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (ExceptionType e) {
    // Code to handle the exception
} finally {
    // Code to be executed regardless of exception occurrence
}
```

- The `finally` block contains code that will be executed no matter what, whether an exception occurs or not.

## Summary

- Try-catch blocks in Java are used for handling exceptions.
- The `try` block contains code that may throw an exception.
- The `catch` block specifies the type of exception to catch and contains code to handle the exception.
- Multiple `catch` blocks can handle different types of exceptions.
- The `finally` block, if present, is executed regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.
