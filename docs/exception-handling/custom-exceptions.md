# Custom Exceptions in Java

In Java, custom exceptions allow you to define your own exception types to handle specific situations in your application. Creating custom exceptions can enhance the clarity and maintainability of your code by providing meaningful error messages. Here, we'll cover the basics of creating and using custom exceptions.

## Creating Custom Exceptions

To create a custom exception in Java, you need to extend the `Exception` class or one of its subclasses.

### Example: CustomCheckedException

```java
public class CustomCheckedException extends Exception {
    public CustomCheckedException() {
        super("This is a custom checked exception");
    }
}
```

### Example: CustomUncheckedException

```java
public class CustomUncheckedException extends RuntimeException {
    public CustomUncheckedException() {
        super("This is a custom unchecked exception");
    }
}
```

## Using Custom Exceptions

Once you have created a custom exception, you can use it in your code by throwing and catching instances of the exception.

### Throwing Custom Exceptions

```java
public class Example {
    public void performOperation() throws CustomCheckedException {
        // Some logic that may lead to the custom checked exception
        throw new CustomCheckedException();
    }
}
```

```java
public class Example {
    public void performOperation() {
        // Some logic that may lead to the custom unchecked exception
        throw new CustomUncheckedException();
    }
}
```

### Catching Custom Exceptions

```java
public class Example {
    public void execute() {
        try {
            performOperation();
        } catch (CustomCheckedException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught custom checked exception: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    public void performOperation() throws CustomCheckedException {
        // Some logic that may lead to the custom checked exception
        throw new CustomCheckedException();
    }
}
```

```java
public class Example {
    public void execute() {
        try {
            performOperation();
        } catch (CustomUncheckedException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught custom unchecked exception: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    public void performOperation() {
        // Some logic that may lead to the custom unchecked exception
        throw new CustomUncheckedException();
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Choose Appropriate Superclass**: Extend `Exception` for checked exceptions and `RuntimeException` for unchecked exceptions based on your use case.

2. **Provide Informative Messages**: Include meaningful error messages in your custom exceptions to aid in debugging.

3. **Document Custom Exceptions**: Add appropriate Javadoc comments to describe the purpose and usage of your custom exceptions.

## Summary

- Custom exceptions in Java are created by extending the `Exception` class or one of its subclasses.
- Throwing custom exceptions allows you to handle specific situations in your application.
- Catching custom exceptions enables you to handle and provide meaningful responses to those exceptions.
- Best practices include choosing the appropriate superclass, providing informative messages, and documenting custom exceptions.
